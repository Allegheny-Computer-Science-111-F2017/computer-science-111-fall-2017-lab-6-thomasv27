# Reflection by Vanessa R. Thomas

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`. This app
challenged my knowledge of the String and Random classes. Namely, figuring out
how to construct new strings consisting of the old string plus or minus a
letter required me to concentrate hard on what index positions I wanted
substrings to start or end at and what numbers I had to type to achieve those
positions. Once I completed the character-adding phase, though, it made the
following phases much easier since I had a feel for the pattern. As far as
explaining my 'strategy,' I guess I just tried to attack each phase one step at
a time and tried to get creative with my random generators.

One limitation of this code is that, at present, it'll only work with
four-character DNA strings. In the future, I'd like to figure out how to adapt
it for DNA strings of any length. (I might already know how to do that, but I'm
not so sure. If I figure it out, I'll recommit!)
